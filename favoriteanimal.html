		History of Dogs
	</h3>
	<p>
		According to the britannica, "Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves (Canis) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago."

	<p>
		Most house dogs live in peoples' houses, but there are also wild dogs. "In the wild, dogs succeed in habitats that provide ample food, water and cover, like forests and brush lands."
